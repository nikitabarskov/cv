\subsection*{Introduction}
    Hi, I'm Nikita, 24 years old software developer from Russia. 
    I live permanently in Oslo since 2019. 
        
    Most of most experience is related to work as a combined Data Engineer 
    and Data Scientist position. I've set up and maintained several projects 
    required as a data engineering part with integration and transforming part,
    and monitoring process, and as a data science part with data exploration, 
    implementing models, doing experiments, and package models into 
    a production solution.
        
    I love to work with data, focus on solving relevant problems, 
    and deliver maintainable solutions, satisfying business requirements. 

    My goal is to find the Data Engineer position in a product development
    company.
