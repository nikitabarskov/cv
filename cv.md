## Summary

Hi, I'm Nikita. I am a data engineer originally from Russia and 
I have been living permanently in Oslo since September 2019. 
    
Most of my experience is related to work as a combined Data Engineer 
and Data Scientist position. I've set up and maintained several projects 
required as a data engineering part with data modelling and actual coding of
data pipelines and configuring data storage, and as a data science 
role with data exploration, designing models, doing experiments, 
and packaging models into a production solution.
    
I love to work with data, focus on solving relevant problems, 
and deliver maintainable solutions, satisfying business requirements.

I am passionate about studying and eager to learn new things for myself.

## Technology Stack

I use Python and Java/Scala as my primary languages. I am familiar with 
DevOps practices and principles, Git, IaaC (Terraform), 
public clouds (Azure and GCP). I have rich experience in the usage of Machine Learning
libraries and techniques (primarily for time series analysis problems, but 
also for image processing and geospatial data).

I am focused on finding pragmatic and ration solutions to the problem, 
flexible in communication, critical and responsible for the work I do,
understand the importance of team working and analysis of feedback.
