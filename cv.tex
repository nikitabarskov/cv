\section*{Barskov Nikita}

Hi, my name is Nikita (pronounce as \textipa{[n\textsuperscript{j}Ik\textsuperscript{j}it@]}). I am a data engineer originally from Russia and
I have been living permanently in Oslo since September 2019.
You can reach me \faEnvelope \href{mailto:nbarskov@gmail.com}{nbarskov@gmail.com}
or \faLinkedin \href{https://linkedin.com/in/nikitabarskov}{linkedin.com/in/nikitabarskov}
in English, Norwegian or Russian. Also you can find my personal code
\faGithub \href{https://github.com/nikitabarskov}{github.com/nikitabarskov}.

\subsection*{Summary}

Most of my experience is related to work as a combined Data Engineer
and Data Scientist positions. I've set up and maintained several projects
required as a data engineering part with data modelling and actual coding of
data pipelines and configuring data storage, and as a data science
role with data exploration, designing models, doing experiments,
and packaging models into a production solution.

I love to work with data, focus on solving relevant problems,
and deliver maintainable solutions, satisfying business requirements.
I am passionate about studying and eager to learn new things for myself.

\subsection*{Experience}

\paragraph*{Data Engineer @ \href{https://coop.no}{Coop Norge}.} April 2021 - now

I am working as a full-time Data Engineer on Coop's Data Platform.

\paragraph*{Data Engineer @ \href{https://www.rystadenergy.com}{Rystad Energy}.} September 2019 - March 2021

My primary responsibility was to implement and maintain a data pipeline for
different projects (maritime and road traffic monitoring applications,
satellite imagery-based projects).

\paragraph*{Data Engineer @ \href{https://inventale.com/en/Inventale}{Inventale}} September 2017 - August 2019

I was developing an application for forecasting users' interactions with
advertising content. The algorithm I built was fundamental to my Master's thesis.
I was responsible for integrating, transforming, forecasting, and quality evaluation parts.

\paragraph*{Intern @ \href{https://resources.piano.io/articles/piano-acquires-cxense-expanding-the-possibilities-of-the-platform-with-data-management-and-intelligent-personalization-capabilities}{Cxense}} April 2017 - August 2017

I was working on a batch processing project at Cxense as Intern.

\subsection*{Technology Stack}

I use Python and Java/Scala as my primary languages. I am familiar with
DevOps practices and principles, Git, IaaC (Terraform),
public clouds (Azure and GCP). I have rich experience in the usage of Machine Learning
libraries and techniques (primarily for time series analysis problems, but
also for image processing and geospatial data).

I am focused on finding pragmatic and rational solutions to the problem,
flexible in communication, critical and responsible for the work I do,
understand the importance of team working and analysis of feedback.
